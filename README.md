# Active-Directory-Project

## Objective

The Active Directory project was designed to establish a fully functional domain environment on-premises. The project uses Splunk for data analysis and employing an attacking machine to simulate a brute force attack on a target system. This hands-on endeavor aimed to provide a deeper understanding of constructing an environment with multiple users, harnessing Splunk for data gathering and analysis, and formulating strategies to increase defensive security measures.
